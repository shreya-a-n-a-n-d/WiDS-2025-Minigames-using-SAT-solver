# WiDS-2025-Minigames-using-SAT-solver

In this project, the first two weeks covered the foundational theory of propositional logic, such as truth assignments, satisfiability, basic Boolean operators, CNF, DNF and DPLL. This was then followed by a python implementation of a basic DPLL algorithm. Using this theory, a SuDoKu solver was first encoded as CNF clauses, which were then solved using a solver, hence creating a SuDoKu solver. Following this, in week 4, a solver for a Sokoban, which is a puzzle video game series in which the player pushes boxes in a warehouse to get them onto storage locations, was created using the cumulative knowledge from week 1 - 3.
